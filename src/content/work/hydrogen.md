## Web Foundation

At Shopify, I was part of the Web Foundation team, which was responsible for our migration from a Ruby on Rails stack to a React stack. This was a monumental task that involved a lot of work on the part of the team, but it was a great opportunity to learn establish myself as a core contributor to the company.

After the migration, the team shifted to focus on building the common layer of our stack, which included common React components, build/deploy workflows, education/training materials, and other aspects of performance and developer experience tooling.

## Resiliency

As a experiment for myself, I spent a year working on the Resiliency team, which was responsible for building the infrastructure and tooling to help Shopify stay online globally. In order to succeed under the pressure of incident response, I needed to quickly level up my cloud infrastructure skills including designing and operating large scale Kubernetes clusters, and building tools to help the incident response team.

Luckily this was during the pandemic, so I was able to study the Google SRE books and use it as a means to distract myself from the global situation. I also relocated from Toronto to Berlin as part of this move and was responsible for building the European incident response team.

## Hydrogen

In my final role at Shopify, I contributed to the development of Hydrogen, an open-source React framework designed for building custom storefronts optimized for Shopify’s ecosystem. Our goal was to empower developers with a performant, opinionated starting point for headless commerce, balancing flexibility with ease of use, and dynamic alternative to our liquid templating system.

Hydrogen was built on modern web technologies like React Server Components and Vite, but when the Shopify acquired Remix, we combined forces with Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson to pivot Hydrogen as a commerce-focused layer on top of Remix. My role involved contributing to the core Hydrogen library and the developer experience, while providing support to the community and ongoing documentation.

This work underscored my passion for creating powerful, design-forward tools that simplify complex workflows while enabling creative expression. As I have moved on from Shopify, I am unsure if Hydrogen remains a key part of Shopify’s vision for the future of headless commerce, but I’m proud to have contributed to its foundation among the other great people on the team.
