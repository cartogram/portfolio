## Introduction

I learned good graphic design from the magazine rack at my local bookstore. Growing up in suburban Canada—before the smartphone or widespread internet—this was one of the few windows I had into design trends. I’d spend hours mentally cataloging what I found interesting, refining my understanding of what “good” looked like, and applying those insights to my own creative work.

That instinct—to collect, curate, and learn by immersion—has stayed with me. In the 2000s, I became obsessed with social bookmarking sites like FFFFOUND!, and I see Cosmos as the closest thing to recapturing that experience. Digital art has been a constant for me in an increasingly chaotic world, and Cosmos creates real value for the people who make it. I want to be part of that—to contribute to a product I genuinely understand and use myself.

## Can you describe your ideal work environment?

I value creativity and autonomy. I am a team player, but thrive when I am invested in the whole idea rather than any single facet. I think in terms of months, but need constant momentum. I like to have fun, and don't need to be told what to do.
