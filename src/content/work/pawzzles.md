A “pandemic-project” and experiment Fiona and I started in 2020 as a fun way to repurpose material that would otherwise have gone to waste — wood veneer offcuts from our other business, [Fondfolio](/work/fondfolio) where we make collaborative memory books.

This is not a money-making venture, and has been mostly unsuccessful to be honest. However, we donate 10% of each sale to animal welfare initiatives and give to a combination of local cat-based charities, such as the Toronto Cat Rescue (where we adopted our cat Minou), and the Effective Altruism Animal Welfare Fund.
