Wildling is a neighbourhood local, a restaurant, a wine bar serving humble food and wines of the earth. Based out of Kelowna, BC and spearheaded by my best Tyler Smiath, I put together a respectable little website to give basic restaurant information and a place to make reservations.

In order to keep things as simple as possible, the site was built with an HTML-first mindset, without any dependencies or front-end frameworks.
