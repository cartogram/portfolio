Based out of Kelowna, BC and spearheaded by my best pal, Tyler Smith, I put together a respectable little website to give basic restaurant information and renforce the vibe of the website. Customers can make reservations, signup for newsletter and get a sense of the food and wine on offer.

In order to keep things as simple as possible, the site was built with an HTML-first mindset, using Astro and no dependencies or front-end frameworks.
